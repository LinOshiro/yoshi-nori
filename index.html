              Yoshi is a feisty 13 year old Silky-Terrier. He can be
              very protective of his home and family. Mostly though he is very
              sweet, playful and loves to give kisses. His favorite game is fetch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yoshi has a sensitive stomach and should not be given a lot of
              treats even though he will always ask for one. Just tell him no!
